# admiral R package and ADaM Implementation Guide Working Group

This Working Group will review the ADaM IG and admiral R Package to determine if there are any gaps in coverage for admiral.

A gap in coverage could be:
  * A function does not exist to address a certain derivation/concept in the IG
  * A function does not provide all possibilities for a certain derivation/concept in the IG
  * Code does not exist (base R, dplyr, etc) that could address a derivation/concept missing in admiral functions/vignettes
  * Documentation in admiral could be enhanced to provide better user accessibility/understanding of derivation/concept in the IG

Working Group members identifying gaps will:
  * Create issues in admiral repo alerting dev team of the gaps
  * Work on updates to the function/documentation to address these issues (NOT REQUIRED)
